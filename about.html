            <p>Hello! My name is Ian Campbell and I'm thrilled to welcome you to my portfolio. Let me tell you a little bit about myself.</p>
            <p>I'm passionate about web development and design. Ever since I was introduced to coding during my time at KSU as an Interactive Design major, I've been fascinated by the endless possibilities of creating beautiful and functional websites. I've spent countless hours honing my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I'm always eager to learn new technologies to enhance my projects.</p>
            <p>My goal is to combine my creative ideas with my technical expertise to build immersive online experiences. Whether it's crafting friendly user interfaces or developing new ideos to solve everyday problems, I strive for excellence in every aspect of my work. I'm excited to continue growing as a developer and to contribute my talents to innovative projects that make a difference.</p>
