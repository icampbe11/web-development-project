            <p>Hello! Welcome to my portfolio webpage. This site is part of my Intro to Web Development project, and it's hosted on GitHub Pages.</p>
            <p>I'm designing and developing this website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Node.js for form submission. My goal is to make sure the website is responsive and user-friendly across different devices. I'm focusing on design aesthetics and user experience by using the best practices for code organization, readability, and documentation.</p>
            <p>This project is a great opportunity to showcase my creativity and apply the web development skills I've learned from my course. My time at KSU as an Interactive Design major has given me the chance to learn website development and coding languages to create web pages. I've developed skills that I will be able to use in my professional career.</p>
